# CD4047 Based Inverter PCB Design

This repository contains a simple DC to AC inverter PCB design based on the CD4047 IC.

## Overview
The circuit uses the CD4047 in astable mode to generate complementary square wave signals, which are used to drive external power transistors/MOSFETs for inverter operation. It is designed mainly for learning, testing, and low-power applications.

## Features
- Based on CD4047 IC
- 12V DC input
- Square wave AC output
- Simple and beginner-friendly design
- PCB designed using EasyEDA

## Files Included
- PCB layout file
- Gerber files for PCB fabrication
- Schematic diagram
- Circuit images 

## Applications
- Educational purposes
- Basic inverter experiments
- Electronics learning projects

## Notes
This design is intended for low-power use. Proper heat sinking and protection components are recommended when connecting loads.
